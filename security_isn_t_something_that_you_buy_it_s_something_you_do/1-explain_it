1) You should create a SSH public and private key pair. You would create this using ssh-keygen program with the -b option to define the encription method you would like to use.
2) You should upload your public key to the computer you wish to remotly connect to. The public key is used to encrypt messages between you and the server. 
3) You should not share your private key with anyone, you should keep it private on your computer. It will be used to decrypt the encrypted messages sent between you and the foreign computer.
